#Project: Jonathan H Chan (Personal Website)

## General Instructions
I want to create and deploy a personal website on my personal Github using Pages.
I am a final-year all-but-dissertation PhD student at the University of Oxford aiming to enter industry (pharma/biotech) specifically in jobs related to statistical genetics and clinical genomics so please tailor and structure details on the website accordingly.
Create this website as a personal portfolio of my scientific work.
Use best practices for self-promotion such as
- Structuring the website so that a hiring manager can easily see how my work would help solve issues/obstacles in industry
- Highlight the value of how my work would translate to industry well (e.g. patient risk stratification)

## Context
Reference files as context to include are provided in the /docs folder.
These include
1) CV
2) Conference poster PDF files (Please include seamlessly and not within a PDF viewer - perhaps by converting to high-resolution images)

## Social
Please also the following external links:
1) LinkedIn page as a LinkedIn button (www.linkedin.com/in/jchan0)
2) Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hwdg8aQAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1)
3) GitHub (https://github.com/JonChan0)

## Layout
The page should be a custom design with the following features:
1) Single page layout
2) Light theme 
3) Seamless transition via scrolling down from section to section with alternating animations
4) Structure like this website demonstration (https://www.awwwards.com/sites/integratedbio)
